<h1>How to be Awesome With Spreadsheets</h1>

<h2>A Tutorial For Awesome Computer Skills</h2>

<p>I get a lot of pleasure from my spreadsheet skills. It‚Äôs good for doing practical things like managing my personal finances. And it is also gives me a nice temporary feeling of control in an otherwise terrifying and chaotic world. üòì</p>

<p>In this tutorial I am going to build a personal budgeting tool so I can get a better sense of where I‚Äôm spending my money. I want to look at my recent transactions, sort all the expenses into categories, and then get a view of how much I‚Äôm spending each month on Food, Rent, Utilities, etc.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a preview to give you a quick sense of what I‚Äôm trying to achieve</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DhJ2a0fVMiI">https://youtu.be/DhJ2a0fVMiI</a></p>

<p>On the way through, I‚Äôll explain some of the more advanced features of Sheets (the spreadsheeting tool in the Google Docs suite), and I‚Äôll call out some of the underlying principles. This will apply to any decent spreadsheet tool, Sheets is just what I‚Äôm familiar with.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to look at: importing data, array formulas, data validation, lookups, conditional statements, filters and pivot tables. In the end we‚Äôll have a sweet interactive tool that gives clear insight into your spending. </p>

<p>If you want to learn how to be awesome, follow along with my steps. You can play around with my spreadsheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfjXVGGYgy60-nkjZ0oRmXI5lZg9jj7_sEy-AIFUYnw/edit?usp=sharing">make a copy of this one</a> and edit it however you like. If you get confused along the way: congratulations, you are learning! Stop and search the web, read the help docs, or ask questions here. By the end of this tutorial, you will be familiar with a powerful set of tools for working with data.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Import data</h2>

<p>First thing I want to do is get the data from my bank.</p>

<p>My bank is Transferwise, but just about any online banking site should give you the option to download all your transactions as a ‚ÄúCSV‚Äù export. CSV just means comma-separated values; it‚Äôs a simple format for storing tables of data.</p>

<p>Then I go to <a href="http://sheets.new">http://sheets.new</a> to start a new spreadsheet, and click File &gt; Import to upload the file I got from the bank.</p>

<figure><img src="01%20Imported%20Data.png"/></figure>

<p><em>Note: if the data formatting looks broken, check that the Locale in the Spreadsheet settings matches your bank. The first time I tried this, the sheet was looking for U.S. date formats but my bank uses European dates.</em></p>

<p>Most of this data is not useful to me, I just care about the Date, Amount and Merchant (Columns B, C, and N). I‚Äôll leave this imported sheet as it is, and then create a new sheet to focus in on the information I want.</p>

<p>I make a new sheet called Categorised. Then I use a function called <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093275?hl=en"><code>ARRAYFORMULA</code></a> to pull in the columns I want. You can see the formula that I‚Äôve used in C1: <code>=ARRAYFORMULA(&#39;Imported data‚Äô!N:N)</code>. That populates the whole C column, pulling from the Imported Data sheet.</p>

<figure><img src="02%20new%20sheet.png"/></figure>

<p>I‚Äôll explain more about <code>ARRAYFORMULA</code> later, but for now all you need to know is that I‚Äôve told it to go to the sheet called ‚ÄòImported data‚Äô and pull in everything in column N. </p>

<p><em>Notice the <strong>design principle</strong> here: in the future, I want to be able to replace the imported data with new transactions. So I‚Äôm going to design this sheet so that all the formulas ‚Äújust work‚Äù even when the data changes. In this instance, I‚Äôve told it to grab <strong>everything</strong> in Column B, regardless of the length. When I import new data, that column will grow or shrink, but the formulas will keep working.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2>Part 2: Categorising the transactions</h2>

<p>The file I imported has about a hundred Transactions. I want to categorise all of them into a short list of maybe 5 or 10 Categories. </p>

<p>I have a lot of Transactions from the same Merchant. So rather than going through them all manually, I want to use some computer magic to recognise that, for example, all Transactions from the Merchant ‚ÄúTrain Italia‚Äù should have the Category ‚ÄúTransport‚Äù.</p>

<p>The first step is to make a list of Categories that I can refer back to in different places throughout the spreadsheet. So I make a new sheet called Categories, and start writing a list:</p>

<figure><img src="03%20categories.png"/></figure>

<p>Then I create some Category matching rules. If the Merchant is ‚ÄúUnicoop Tirreno‚Äù (a supermarket nearby), that should be categorised as ‚ÄúFood‚Äù. ‚ÄúPisa Mover‚Äù is a train, so I want to automatically categorise that as ‚ÄúTransport‚Äù. So I manually write this list of Merchants and Category Matches:</p>

<figure><img src="04%20category%20matching.png"/></figure>

<p>Now, over on the Categorised sheet, I add a new column called Auto Category. I want it to look up my Category Match table, and automatically populate a Category here if it finds a match. To do this I use the <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093318?hl=en"><code>VLOOKUP</code></a> function:</p>

<figure><img src="05%20vlookup.png"/></figure>

<p>The formula in D3 is <code>=VLOOKUP(C2,Categories!C:D,2,false)</code>. In English, that means <em>‚ÄúLook for ‚ÄúUnicoop Tirreno‚Ä¶‚Äù in the Category Match table. If you find it, return what you find in the 2nd column‚Äù</em>. It found a match, so it returns the ‚ÄúFood‚Äù Category. So far, so good!</p>

<p>Now I want to repeat this for the whole column. To do this, I use our old friend <code>ARRAYFORMULA</code>. I think of it as a function to stretch other functions. <code>VLOOKUP</code> can only find one cell at a time. But if we wrap it in an <code>ARRAYFORMULA</code>, it will stretch and look at the whole column. Notice in Row 7 it has found another match:</p>

<figure><img src="06%20arrayformula.png"/></figure>

<p>Unfortunately, it leaves an ugly <code>#N/A</code> error whenever it searches for a Merchant that it can‚Äôt find in the Category Match table.</p>

<p><em>There‚Äôs another design principle here: if you hit a problem and you can imagine that a lot of other people have had that problem before you, there‚Äôs probably a good solution out there!</em></p>

<p>So I searched the web, ‚Äúgoogle sheets hide formula errors‚Äù, and I learned about a function called <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093304?hl=en"><code>IFERROR</code></a>. You can use that to tell the formula what to do if it hits an error. In this case, I want it to do nothing, just leave the cell blank. So I update the formula once more, and aaaah that‚Äôs better, no ugly error messages:</p>

<figure><img src="07%20if%20error.png"/></figure>

<p>The Auto Category column is only used for the Merchants that I frequently buy from. For the rest, I need to add the category manually. </p>

<p>I create a new column, Manual Categories. But I don‚Äôt want to just type out all the categories by hand, I want to <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/186103?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop">select them from a pre-defined list</a>. To do this, I used Data Validation (in the Data menu).</p>

<p>With these Data Validation settings‚Ä¶</p>

<figure><img src="08%20data%20validation.png"/></figure>

<p>‚Ä¶all of the cells in column E get this sweet dropdown menu, which is populated by the list I wrote on the Categories sheet.</p>

<figure><img src="09%20dropdown.png"/></figure>

<p>If I decide later to add new Categories to the list, they‚Äôll show up on the dropdown menu automagically. If I manually type in a Manual Category that is not on the list, it will warn me with a little red triangle. I know, it‚Äôs pretty sick, right?</p>

<p>So now I‚Äôll go thru all my transactions, and categorise them. If I notice the same Merchant keeps showing up in the list, I‚Äôll add a new entry to the CategoryMatch table, and the Auto Category column will update.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs annoying having these Categories in two different columns ‚ÄúAuto‚Äù and ‚ÄúManual‚Äù though, I want to combine them. So I make a new column called ‚ÄúCategory‚Äù, and use a couple of cute little functions: <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093364?hl=en"><code>IF</code></a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093290?hl=en"><code>ISBLANK</code></a>. Here‚Äôs how it works: ‚ÄúIF((this statement is true), (do this thing), (otherwise do this other thing))‚Äù.</p>

<p>So I tell it: if the Manual Category is blank, give me the Auto Category, otherwise use the Manual Category:</p>

<figure><img src="10%20if%20is%20blank.png"/></figure>

<p>And then I want to stretch that formula to cover the whole column, so it‚Äôs time for another <code>ARRAYFORMULA</code>.</p>

<figure><img src="11%20array%20formula.png"/></figure>

<p>Muhahahah! Can you feel the raw power!!!</p>

<h2>Part 3: Monthly Summary</h2>

<p>Hokay, so now all the transactions are categorised, I want to see a monthly summary: where am I spending my money?</p>

<p>Enter: <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/1272900?hl=en">pivot tables</a>.</p>

<p>A pivot table is a powerful way to cut different slices thru your data. In this case, I want a table that has a column for each month, and a row for each transaction category.</p>

<p>To do this, I select all Columns A thru F on the Categorised sheet, and then click Data &gt; Pivot Table. This opens a new sheet, with the Pivot Table Editor. I set Rows: Category, Columns: Date, and Values: Amount.</p>

<figure><img src="12%20pivot%20table.png"/></figure>

<p>This is nearly there, but I want one column per month, instead of one column per day like it is currently showing. Easy fixed: right click on one of the dates, and select ‚ÄúCreate pivot date group &gt; Month‚Äù. Hey presto:</p>

<figure><img src="13%20group%20by%20month.png"/></figure>

<p>So now I can clearly see how much I‚Äôm spending on Food every month, which is very useful for my budget. This will help me make more accurate predictions about future spending.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Part 4: Category browser</h2>

<p>One last thing: I want a view that shows me all the transactions for a given Category. </p>

<p>I‚Äôll make another sheet called ‚ÄúCategory Browser‚Äù. I want another one of those sweet dropdown menus, so I can select a Category, and then see all the transactions that match. I use the Data Validation again to get the dropdown.</p>

<p>Then I need the <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093197?hl=en"><code>FILTER</code></a> function, which takes a table, and a condition, and returns all the rows that match the condition.</p>

<figure><img src="14%20filter.png"/></figure>

<p>The formula is <code>=FILTER(Categorised!A:F,Categorised!F:F=A2)</code>, that means, get all the data from the Categorised sheet (Columns A:F), and show me the rows that match the Category in A2 (‚ÄúFood‚Äù). </p>

<p>When I change the Category in A2 to ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù, the Browser updates to show me all the Transactions that match ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù</p>

<figure><img src="15%20change%20category.png"/></figure>

<p>That‚Äôs it! If you made it this far, you are now officially Awesome With Spreadsheets. Life is basically plain sailing from here on out.</p>
